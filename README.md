# Self_Driving_Car_Simulation
This project uses Udacity's car simulator app as an environment to create our own autonomous agent. It uses Keras to train a convolutional neural network on images from the car's cameras as well as steering angles from human driving. Using just these two data points, it'll will be able to drive itself on any road.
